\subsection{QUDA: A library for QCD on GPUs}


The QUDA \cite{Clark:2009wm, Babich:2011np, Strelchenko:2013vaa} interface is complementary to tmLQCD's own CUDA kernels for computations on the GPU by Florian Burger.
So far it is exclusively used for inversions.

\subsubsection{Design goals of the interface}
The QUDA interface has been designed with the following goals in mind, sorted by priority:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{Safety.} Naturally, highest priority is given to the correctness of the output of the interface. 
	This is trivially achieved by always checking the final residual on the CPU with the default tmLQCD routines.
	\item \emph{Ease of use.} Within the operator declarations of the input file (between {\ttfamily BeginOperator} and {\ttfamily EndOperator}) a simple flag {\ttfamily UseQudaInverter} is introduced which, when set to {\ttfamily yes}, will let QUDA perform the inversion of that operator. The operators {\ttfamily TMWILSON, WILSON, DBTMWILSON} and {\ttfamily CLOVER} are supported.\footnote{{\ttfamily DBCLOVER} is supported by the interface but not by QUDA as of version 0.7.0.}
	\item \emph{Minimality.} Minimal changes in the form of {\ttfamily \#ifdef QUDA} precompiler directives to the tmLQCD code base. The main bulk of the interface lies in a single separate file {\ttfamily quda\_interface.c} (with corresponding header file). In the file {\ttfamily operators.c}, the QUDA library is initialized when an operator is initialized which has set {\ttfamily UseQudaInverter = yes}. There, the actual call to the inverter is conditionally replaced with a call to the QUDA interface.
	\item \emph{Performance.} The higher priority of the previous items results in small performance detriments. In particular:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item tmLQCD's $\theta$-boundary conditions disallow QUDA's 12 parameter reconstruction of the gauge fields (as of QUDA-0.7.0). Choosing to use trivial (anti-)periodic BC within {\ttfamily quda\_interface.c} overcomes this limitation but the final CPU residual check with tmLQCD routines cannot be passed then. Therefore the default is to not use 12 parameter reconstruction.
		\item The gaugefield is transferred each time to the GPU before the inversion starts in order to ensure not to miss any modifications of the gaugefield.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Installation}
If not already installed, you have to install QUDA first. Download the most recent version from \url{http://lattice.github.io/quda/}. Note that QUDA version $\geq 0.7.0$ is required (chiral gamma basis).

QUDA can be installed without any dependencies, consider, e.g., the following minimal configuration:

\begin{verbatim}
./configure CC=mpicc CXX=mpiCC \
CFLAGS="-O3 -std=c99" CXXFLAGS="-O3 -std=c++0x" \
--prefix=$QUDADIR \
--with-mpi=$MPI_PATH \
--with-cuda=$CUDADIR \
--enable-os=linux \
--enable-cpu-arch=x86_64 \
--enable-gpu-arch=sm_35 \
--enable-multi-gpu \
--enable-wilson-dirac \
--enable-clover-dirac \
--enable-twisted-mass-dirac \
--enable-ndeg-twisted-mass-dirac \
--enable-twisted-clover-dirac \
--enable-device-pack
\end{verbatim}
where {\ttfamily \$CUDADIR} and {\ttfamily \$MPI\_PATH} have to be set appropriately.
{\ttfamily \$QUDADIR} is your choice for the installation directory of QUDA.
In order to profit from QUDA's autotuning functionality, set the environment variable {\ttfamily QUDA\_RESOURCE\_PATH} to a directory of your choice, e.g., add
\begin{verbatim}
export QUDA_RESOURCE_PATH=${HOME}/quda_resources/
\end{verbatim}
to your {\ttfamily $\sim$/.bash\_profile}.

Once QUDA is installed, a minimal configuration of tmLQCD could look like, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
./configure CC=mpicc \
--prefix=$TMLQCDDIR \
--with-limedir=$LIMEDIR \
--with-lapack=<linker-flags> \
--enable-mpi \
--with-mpidimension=4 \
CXX=mpiCC \
--with-qudadir=$QUDADIR \
--with-cudadir=${CUDADIR}/lib
\end{verbatim}
Note that a {\ttfamily C++} compiler is required for linking against the QUDA library, therefore set {\ttfamily CXX} appropriately. {\ttfamily \${QUDADIR}} is where you installed QUDA in the previous step and {\ttfamily \${CUDADIR}} is required again for linking.


\subsubsection{Usage}
Any main program that reads and handles the operator declaration from an input file can easily be set up to use the QUDA inverter by setting the {\ttfamily UseQudaInverter} flag to {\ttfamily yes}. For example, in the input file for the {\ttfamily invert} executable, add the flag to the operator declaration as
\begin{verbatim}
BeginOperator TMWILSON
  2kappaMu = 0.05
  kappa = 0.177
  UseEvenOdd = yes
  Solver = CG
  SolverPrecision = 1e-14
  MaxSolverIterations = 1000
  UseQudaInverter = yes
EndOperator
\end{verbatim}
and the operator of interest will be inverted using QUDA. The initialization of QUDA is done automatically within the operator initialization,  the QUDA library should be finalized by a call to {\ttfamily \_endQuda()} just before finalizing MPI. When you use the QUDA interface for work that is being published, don't forget to cite \cite{Clark:2009wm, Babich:2011np, Strelchenko:2013vaa}.


\subsubsection{Functionality}
The QUDA interface can currently be used to invert {\ttfamily TMWILSON, WILSON, DBTMWILSON} and {\ttfamily CLOVER} within a 4D multi-GPU (MPI) parallel environment with CG or BICGSTAB. QUDA uses even-odd preconditioning, if wanted ({\ttfamily UseEvenOdd = yes}), and the interface is set up to use a mixed precision solver by default. For more details on the QUDA settings check the function {\ttfamily \_initQuda()} in {\ttfamily quda\_interface.c}.
